Problem Statement :
                    The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently 
                    fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. 
                    You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.
                    
Problem Code: INTEST


// Solution 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n , k , i  ;
   cin >> n >> k ;
   int a[n] , count = 0 ;
   for( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ )
   {
       cin >> a[i] ;
       if( a[i] % k == 0 )
       {
           count = count + 1 ;
       }
   }
   cout << count ;
    return 0;
}
