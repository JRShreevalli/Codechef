// SOLUTION 1 -----> ONLY SUBTAST GOT EXECUTED 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fun( double s , double  a , double b , double c )
{
    double val , res ;
    val =  (c * s) / 100 ;
    
    if( c > 0 )
    {
        res =  s + val ;
    }
    if( c < 0 )
    {
        res =  s - val ;
    }

    if ( res >= a && res <= b )
        cout << "Yes" << endl ;
        
    else
        cout << "No" << endl ;
        
    return 0 ;
