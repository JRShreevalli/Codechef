Problem Statement :
                    There is a grid of size 105×105, covered completely in railway tracks. 
                    Tom is riding in a train, currently in cell (a,b), and Jerry is tied up in a different cell (c,d), 
                    unable to move. The train has no breaks. It shall move exactly K steps, and then its fuel will run 
                    out and it shall stop. In one step, the train must move to one of its neighboring cells, sharing a side.
                    Tom can’t move without the train, as the grid is covered in tracks. Can Tom reach Jerry’s cell after exactly K steps?

                    Note: Tom can go back to the same cell multiple times.

// SOLUTION 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

{
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int a,b,c,d,K;
        cin>>a>>b>>c>>d>>K;
        int cnt=0;
        cnt=abs(a-c)+abs(b-d);
        if(cnt==K)
        {
            cout<<"YES"<<"\n";
        }
        else
